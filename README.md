# LiveSplit.SpyroTheDragonMusicPlayer
A LiveSplit component which plays music you specify for each level of Spyro the Dragon (1998, NTSC-U) on emulator.

While speedrunning Spyro the Dragon on an emulator, you lose time compared to a PS2 because of longer load times; one source of slower loading is the game's music, which can be disabled for faster load times. Some choose to turn off the music and listen to either eerie silence or their own music, while some keep the music on, tolerating the slower load times, because the game's music is just that good. 

This component enables you to "have your cake and eat it too," so to speak, by simulating the game's music playback using sound files you store on your file system, reading the game's memory to automatically determine which level you're on and whether music should be playing right now.
